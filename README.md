# Sorting_Visualiser

## About the Project

- The Sorting Visualiser is an interactive tool designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms.
- It provides a step-by-step animation of how sorting algorithms work, making it easier to grasp their concepts and efficiency.

## Features

- Visual representation of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Adjustable speed controls to observe the sorting process at different paces.
- Customizable array size and values for testing different scenarios.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **InfoPanels**: Displays detailed information about each sorting algorithm, including its time complexity, space complexity, and step-by-step explanation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Highlights the efficiency of each algorithm by showing runtime and comparisons made during sorting.
- **Color-Coded Visualization**: Uses colors to represent the current state of the array (e.g., green for sorted, red for comparisons) for better understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for creating the interactive visualizer.
- **Visualization**: Canvas or DOM manipulation for rendering animations.
- **Algorithms**: Implementation of sorting algorithms in JavaScript.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to provide an educational tool for students and developers to learn and understand sorting algorithms through visualization. It bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding.
